Releason is an automated webpage tracker primarily used to track store pages for new drops. While most companies have newsletters that will send you emails
when they drop new items, many smaller businesses do not have this or the notifications always come too late and everything is sold out when you hear 
about it. This is the inspiration for Releason. Type in the webpage URL you want to track and you will be automatically notified of any changes to the 
store page.
